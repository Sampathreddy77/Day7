        <h3>Chapter1-Pollution</h3>
        <p id="A">

            Pollution is the introduction of contaminants into the natural environment that cause adverse change.[1]
            Pollution can take the form of any substance (solid, liquid, or gas) or energy (such as radioactivity, heat,
            sound, or light). Pollutants, the components of pollution, can be either foreign substances/energies or
            naturally occurring contaminants.

            Although environmental pollution can be caused by natural events, the word pollution generally implies that
            the contaminants have an anthropogenic source – that is, a source created by human activities, such as
            manufacturing, extractive industries, poor waste management, transportation or agriculture. Pollution is
            often classed as point source (coming from a highly concentrated specific site, such as a factory, mine,
            construction site), or nonpoint source pollution (coming from a widespread distributed sources, such as
            microplastics or agricultural runoff).

            Many sources of pollution were unregulated parts of industrialization during the 19th and 20th centuries
            until the emergence of environmental regulation and pollution policy in the later half of the 20th century.
            Sites where historically polluting industries released persistent pollutants may have legacy pollution long
            after the source of the pollution is stopped. Major forms of pollution include air pollution, water
            pollution, litter, noise pollution, plastic pollution, soil contamination, radioactive contamination,
            thermal pollution, light pollution, and visual pollution.

            Pollution has widespread consequences on human and environmental health, having systematic impact on social
            and economic systems. In 2019, pollution killed nine million people worldwide (one in six deaths), a number
            unchanged since 2015.[2][3][4] Air pollution accounted for 3⁄4 of these earlier deaths.[5][6] A 2022
            literature review found that levels of anthropogenic chemical pollution have exceeded planetary boundaries
            and now threaten entire ecosystems around the world.[7][8] Pollutants frequently have outsized impacts on
            vulnerable populations, such as children and the elderly, and marginalized communities, because polluting
            industries and toxic waste sites tend to be collocated with populations with less economic and political
            power.[9] This outsized impact is a core reason for the formation of the environmental justice
            movement,[10][11] and continues to be a core element of environmental conflicts, particularly in the Global
            South.

        <h3>Chapter2: Air Pollution</h3>
        <p id="B">
            Air pollution is the contamination of air due to the presence of substances called pollutants in the
            atmosphere that are harmful to the health of humans and other living beings, or cause damage to the climate
            or to materials.[1] It is also the contamination of the indoor or outdoor environment either by chemical,
            physical, or biological agents that alters the natural features of the atmosphere.[1] There are many
            different types of air pollutants, such as gases (including ammonia, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide,
            nitrous oxides, methane and chlorofluorocarbons), particulates (both organic and inorganic), and biological
            molecules. Air pollution can cause diseases, allergies, and even death to humans; it can also cause harm to
            other living organisms such as animals and crops, and may damage the natural environment (for example,
            climate change, ozone depletion or habitat degradation) or built environment (for example, acid rain).[2]
            Air pollution can be caused by both human activities[3] and natural phenomena.[4]

            Air quality is closely related to the Earth's climate and ecosystems globally. Many of the contributors of
            air pollution are also sources of greenhouse emission i.e., burning of fossil fuel.[1]

            Air pollution is a significant risk factor for a number of pollution-related diseases, including respiratory
            infections, heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), stroke, and lung cancer.[5] Growing
            evidence suggests that air pollution exposure may be associated with reduced IQ scores, impaired
            cognition,[6] increased risk for psychiatric disorders such as depression[7] and detrimental perinatal
            health.[8] The human health effects of poor air quality are far reaching, but principally affect the body's
            respiratory system and the cardiovascular system.[9][10] Individual reactions to air pollutants depend on
            the type of pollutant a person is exposed to,[11][12] the degree of exposure, and the individual's health
            status and genetics.[13]

            Air pollution is the largest environmental risk factor for disease and premature death[5][14] and the fourth
            largest risk factor overall for human health.[15] Air pollution causes the premature deaths of around 7
            million people worldwide each year,[5] or a global mean loss of life expectancy (LLE) of 2.9 years,[16] and
            there has been no significant change in the number of deaths caused by all forms of pollution since at least
            2015.[14][17][18] Outdoor air pollution attributable to fossil fuel use alone causes ~3.61 million deaths
            annually,[19] making it one of the top contributors to human death.[5] Anthropogenic ozone causes around
            470,000 premature deaths a year and fine particulate (PM2.5) pollution around another 2.1 million.[20] The
            scope of the air pollution crisis is large: In 2018, WHO estimated that "9 out of 10 people breathe air
            containing high levels of pollutants."[21] Although the health consequences are extensive, the way the
            problem is handled is considered largely haphazard[22][21][23] or neglected.[14]

            The World Bank has estimated that welfare losses (premature deaths) and productivity losses (lost labour)
            caused by air pollution cost the world economy $5 trillion per year.[24][25][26] The costs of air pollution
            are generally an externality to the contemporary economic system and most human activity, although they are
            sometimes recovered through monitoring, legislation, and regulation.[27][28]

            Many different technologies and strategies are available for reducing air pollution.[29] Although a majority
            of countries have air pollution laws, according to UNEP, 43 percent of countries lack a legal definition of
            air pollution, 31 percent lack outdoor air quality standards, 49 percent restrict their definition to
            outdoor pollution only, and just 31 percent have laws for tackling pollution originating from outside their
            borders.[30] National air quality laws have often been highly effective, notably the 1956 Clean Air Act in
            Britain and the US Clean Air Act, introduced in 1963.[31][32] Some of these efforts have been successful at
            the international level, such as the Montreal Protocol,[33] which reduced the release of harmful ozone
            depleting chemicals, and the 1985 Helsinki Protocol,[34] which reduced sulfur emissions,[35] while others,
            such as international action on climate change,[36][37][38] have been less successful.

        <h3>Chapter3:Biological Pollution</h3>

        <p id="C">
            Biological pollution (impacts or bio pollution) is the impact of humanity's actions on the quality of
            aquatic and terrestrial environment. Specifically, biological pollution is the introduction of
            non-indigenous and invasive species,[1] otherwise known as Invasive Alien Species (IAS). When the biological
            pollution is introduced to an aquatic environment, it contributes to water pollution.

            Biopollution may cause adverse effects at several levels of biological organization:

            an individual organism (internal pollution by parasites or pathogens),
            a population (by genetic change, i.e. hybridization of IAS with a native species),
            a community or biocoenosis (by structural shifts, i.e. dominance of IAS, replacement or elimination of
            native species),
            a habitat (by modification of physical-chemical conditions),
            an ecosystem (by alteration of energy and organic material flow).
            Biopollution may also cause decline in naturalness of nature conservation areas, adverse economic
            consequences and impacts on human health. The notion of "biological pollution" and "biological pollutants"
            described by Elliott (2003)[2] is generally accepted in invasion biology; it was used to develop the concept
            of biopollution level assessment (Olenin et al., 2007[3]) and criteria for a Good Ecological Status
            descriptor in the European Marine Strategy Framework Directive (Olenin et al., 2010)[4]

            The magnitude of the bioinvasion impact or biopollution level (Olenin et al., 2007[3]) may be quantified
            using a free online service BINPAS.

            In 1991 The Indiana Academy of Science held a national cross disciplinary conference in Indianapolis
            (McKnight 1993), the first of its find dealing with the issue.
